# easy.mlp

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of easy.mlp is to quickly and easily build a neural network to fit tabular data.

* Supports the usage of the R `formula` class.
* Normalizes input and output data to the range of 0-1.
* One-hot encodes input factor data.
* Allows for any number of hidden layers and nodes.
* Supports regression, classification, and binary classification networks.
* Multiple pre-defined activation functions (and supports user-defined functions).
* Mini-batch gradient descent using the ADAM optimizer.
* Randomly splits data into training and validation data.
* Simple plotting of metrics and predictions for new data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of easy.mlp from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("easy.mlp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(easy.mlp)

data(iris)

network <- create.mlp(Species ~ ., data=iris, hidden=c(5,5,5))

network <- train(network, 100)

plot(network)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
